**NOCtools** is a mixed bag of tools and utilities that are useful for NOC engineers.
This project originally started out as a way to highlight and utilise the
[OSS_SNMP](https://github.com/opensolutions/OSS_SNMP) library (*a PHP SNMP library for people who hate SNMP*).

It since grew into a way to graphically present information on network topology that is normally
difficult and cumbersome to do by logging into individual devices. Such information includes a
discovered L2 topology by CDP, using this to present rapid-PVST port roles and so forth.
