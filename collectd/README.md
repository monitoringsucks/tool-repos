collectd gathers statistics about the system it is running on and stores 
this information. Those statistics can then be used to find current
performance bottlenecks (i.e. performance analysis) and predict future 
system load (i.e. capacity planning). Or if you just want pretty graphs 
of your private server and are fed up with some homegrown solution you're
at the right place, too ;).
