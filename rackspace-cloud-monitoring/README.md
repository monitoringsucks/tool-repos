## Rackspace Cloud Monitoring

Rackspace Cloud Monitoring analyzes cloud services and dedicated infrastructure
using a simple, yet powerful API. The API currently includes monitoring for
external services. The key benefits you receive from using this API include the
following:

### Use of Domain Specific Language I(DSL)
The Rackspace Cloud Monitoring API uses a DSL, which makes it a powerful tool
for configuring advanced monitoring features. For example, typically complex
tasks, such as defining triggers on thresholds for metrics or performing an
inverse string match become much easier with a concise, special purpose language
created for defining alarms. For more information, see Alarms.

### Monitoring from Multiple Datacenters
Rackspace Cloud Monitoring allows you to simultaneously monitor the performance
of different resources from multiple datacenters and provides a clear picture of
overall system health. It includes tunable parameters to interpret mixed results
which help you to create deliberate and accurate alerting policies. See Alert
Policies for more information.

### Alarms and Notifications
When an alarm occurs on a monitored resource, Rackspace Cloud Monitoring sends
you a notification so that you can take the appropriate action to either prevent
an adverse situation from occurring or rectify a situation that has already
occurred. These notifications are sent based on the severity of the alert as
defined in the notification plan.
